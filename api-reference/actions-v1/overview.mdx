These endpoints have been deprecated in favour of Actions V2 and Follow-ups V2, as these concepts have become increasingly separate.

Incidents have two types of actions associated to them:

<Card title="Actions" icon="play" iconType="duotone">
  Used during an incident response as ephemeral todo lists
</Card>
<Card title="Follow-ups" icon="people" iconType="duotone">
  Actions which are for after the incident and can be exported to external issue trackers
</Card>

You can manage actions in the incident Slack channel with `/incident actions`, or on the incident homepage.

Exporting follow-ups to external issue trackers can be done in the incident homepage.
